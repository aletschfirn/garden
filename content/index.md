title: Welcome to Aletschfirn's garden.

As days pass, I think on how can I share knowledge more easily and efficently without going a lot of times through different wiki's so I can quote it or share a link to it.

And here I am with digital garden of knowledge and thoughts, based on Quartz v4 with some (maybe) modifications (which are not implemented as of now, but I'll try to make them in future).

What to read:

[[r4ag-xiaomi-router | My router (Mi Router 4A Gigabit v2)]], or [[tp-link-c20 | My modem-router TP-Link Archer C20, which I use to connect to ISP over PPPoE]]

[[split-tunneling | Split Tunneling on local network]]

[[openwrt | OpenWRT]]

[[rkn | RosKomNadzor]]
